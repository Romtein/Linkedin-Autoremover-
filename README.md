# Linkedin-Autoremover-
Clearing old contacts to start fresh with linkedin

So if you're anything like me and have spent your years on linkedin accepting every invite you get (and spamming other poor souls with your own invites) you probably have some ridiculous situation with thousands of connections that you dont know, never will know, and have zero overlap for you to benefit them or visa versa 

This program allows you to do a full reset of your connections so you dont have to create an new account. The bot will take control of your mouse and keyboard to delete all (up to 10,000) of your Linkedin connections, letting you start fresh and only accept invitations/connections that are actually relevant and mutually beneficial for you 

Enjoy
